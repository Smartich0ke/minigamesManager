# minigamesManager
MinigamesManager is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft Java Edition servers. It is designed to be the backbone behind your typical minigames system of putting players in a waiting "lobby" until the max required players is reached, then teleporting them to spots in and "arena".

## **This plugin is still in a very early development stage and is not ready for use with your Minecraft server yet!**
